This project was developed as an exercise to prepare the exam for the university course [Fondamenti di informatica II](http://www-3.unipv.it/ingserv//didattica/schedacorso1314.php?cod=502476&spec=0), in the time between 26/02/2014 and 30/04/2014.

The purpose was to create a GUI to play the classic game minesweeper.

It was written with Java 7, but it still works with Java 17.
